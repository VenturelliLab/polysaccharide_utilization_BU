MATLAB scripts for inference of parameters in mathematical models of single strain growth, interspecies interactions, and butyrate production, related to Figure 1, 5 and S8.

Description: 

Each subfolder contains the scripts and experimental data needed to perform inference of models parameters. A separate README file is provided in each subfolder to describe the specific scripts and data in more detail. 

- Subfolder "Scripts for Figure 1B": MATLAB scripts that use adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to infer growth parameters (i.e., growth rate and carrying capacity) from single strain growth data in different glycans. 

- Subfolder "Scripts for Figure 5C": MATLAB script to obtain the linear regression model for butyrate production.

- Subfolder "Scripts for Figures 5A-B & S8A": MATLAB scripts that use adaptive MCMC to infer interspecies interaction parameters and growth parameters in generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) models using co-culture experimental data in different glycans.
