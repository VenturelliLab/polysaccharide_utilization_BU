README:

This folder contains a script and all raw data used to generate Figure 5C in the main text of 

Feng et al "Polysaccharide utilization loci in Bacteroides determine population fitness and community-level interactions", submitted for publication in Cell Host & Microbe.

A brief description of each items in this folder can be found below:

- "butyrate_prediction.m": MATLAB script used to extract experimental data, perform regression, and compared predicted butyrate concentration with experimental observations.

- folder named "data": This folder contains measured butyrate concentrations in all pairs and fiber conditions.

- folder named "MCMC_fit": This folder contains inferred parameters from MCMC (generated by scripts for Figures 5A-B & S8A) and the simulated final abundance of all species in different fiber conditions.
